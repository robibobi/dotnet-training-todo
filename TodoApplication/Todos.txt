This are the Tasks for the next two weeks:

A) Finish the refactoring ✔

1. Make the ITodoItemRepository async as well.
2. Implement the error handling in the TodoItemRespository (All Methods should return a Result<T>).
   -> Make sure you log all error in the viewmodel.
   -> Whenever there is an error: Show an Error-Dialog to the user.
3. Implement logging in our TodoApplication.
4. Update all Integration- and Unit-Tests. Cover error handling with tests.


B) Implement a OK/Cancel-Dialog on the IDialogService ✔

Show this dialog to the user when the "delete todo" button is clicked.
If the user clicks "ok" then the todo item should be deleted. When the user clicks the cancel button.
The item does not get deleted.


C) Implement "Search as you type" for the todo-item list. ✔

Create a textfield on top of the todo-items list. When the user enters some text in the textfield, the todo-item list will be filtered. Only todo items that have the entered text in its name or describtion will be shown.
HINT: Have a look at the ICollectionView.Filter handler.


D) Make your Todo-Application look beautiful

Use all the controls and styles and attached properties from the MaterialDesignXaml library. 
The winner gets free coffee from tobi the next time he is in the office!
